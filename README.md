# Automatic-Pathfinding
A star algorithm

This project is based on the classic tank game â€“ Battle City. For enemy tanks, each tank is an artificial intelligent agent and A Star Algorithm is used for path searching. The target is mutable for enemy tanks, as it could be either the castle or the player. Each enemy tank follows the path generated to its target every time.
